        <p>Kyoya Tategami is one of the most fierce and strongest competitors in the beyblade world</p>
        <p>He wields the might Leone(Lion) and has taken down and faced many of the strongest oppenents ever known</p>
        <p>Kyoya is known for his bravery and his never-back-down attitude, and this was shown in his fight against Ryuga(the strongest competitor at the time). He didnt back down or show any fear.</p>
        <p>He is a "Friend" of Ginka Hagane as in he never really shows his emotions so one could not tell if he really cares or not.</p>
        <p>All anyone will say is that Kyoya is an opponent to be feared and treated with respect.</p>
